# /dev Root Directory Policy

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## Purpose
Keep `/dev` root clean and navigable. Historical documents and one-off scripts must be archived.

---

## Canonical Files (Allowed in /dev Root)

### Documentation (11 files)
1. `AI-PROGRAMMING-RULES.md` - Development guidelines and coding standards
2. `EVENT-SYSTEM-PLAN.md` - Event architecture and data model
3. `EVENT-TYPES-GUIDE.md` - Event type definitions and behavior
4. `FIREBASE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Firebase configuration instructions
5. `IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md` - Product roadmap and planned features
6. `QUICK-RESET.md` - Database reset procedures
7. `QUICK-START-TAB-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Tab navigation architecture
8. `README.md` - Main project documentation
9. `RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Deployment procedures
10. `TAB-ARCHITECTURE-LOCKED.md` - Locked tab design decisions
11. `TESTING-GUIDE-PHASE2C.md` - Testing procedures and checklist

### Scripts (2 files)
1. `start-all.sh` - Start all servers (frontend + backend)
2. `start-servers.sh` - Alternative server start script

### Subdirectories
- `gathergrove-frontend/` - Frontend repository
- `gathergrove-backend/` - Backend repository
- `backups/` - Version backups
- `temp/` - Temporary working files
- `archive/` - Historical artifacts (see Archive Policy below)

---

## Archive Policy

### Historical Documents → `archive/dev-history/`
**When to archive:**
- Implementation logs (e.g., `HOUSEHOLD-SELECTOR-IMPROVEMENT.md`)
- Status updates (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md`)
- Completed feature summaries (e.g., `CALENDAR-PHASE1-COMPLETE.md`)
- Bug fix documentation (e.g., `ADDRESS-SKIP-FLOW-FIX.md`)
- Any markdown file describing **past work** rather than **current architecture**

### One-off Scripts → `archive/dev-scripts/`
**When to archive:**
- Single-use setup scripts (e.g., `backup-original-prototype.sh`)
- Debugging/testing scripts (e.g., `test-backend.sh`)
- Migration scripts that have already run
- Any `.sh`, `.py`, or other script that was used once and is no longer needed

### Temporary Artifacts → Delete (do not archive)
- `*.log` files (e.g., `firebase-debug.log`, `frontend.log`)
- `*.tmp` files
- Debug output files

---

## The Golden Rule

**No new `.md` files in `/dev` root unless:**
1. It describes **current architecture** or **active procedures**
2. You add it to the Canonical Files list above
3. It replaces an existing canonical file

**Historical documentation = archive/dev-history/**  
**One-off scripts = archive/dev-scripts/**

---

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before adding a new file to `/dev` root, ask yourself:

✅ **Is this file describing current architecture or active procedures?**
- YES → Add to `/dev` root + update canonical list above
- NO → Move to `archive/dev-history/`

✅ **Is this a reusable script I'll run regularly?**
- YES → Keep in `/dev` root + update canonical list above
- NO → Move to `archive/dev-scripts/`

✅ **Is this a temporary artifact (log, debug output, etc.)?**
- YES → Delete it (or add to `.gitignore` if generated by tools)
- NO → Proceed with appropriate location

✅ **Does the filename clearly indicate its purpose?**
- NO → Rename before committing
- YES → Proceed

## Enforcement

**Janitor Audit Frequency:** Monthly (or when `/dev` root exceeds 20 files)

**Audit Process:**
1. List all files in `/dev` root
2. Compare against Canonical Files list above
3. Archive or delete any files not on the list
4. Update this policy if canonical list changes

**Responsibility:** All developers contributing to this workspace
